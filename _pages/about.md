Welcome to my personal website!

My name ***Yinwei Zhang***. I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Arizona majoring in ***Industrial Engineering***. The University of Arizona locates at Tucson, south-western America. The weather is super dry and the temperature is crazy here during the summer, so we don't have many green trees but saguaro cactus here.   

**About my Ph.D. career**
I have been studying in the University of Arizona for 7 years. I first came here as a master's student in the Department of Systems and Industrial Engineering. This department is famous for its operation research and quality engineering. After I got my master degree, I started to pursue my Ph.D. degree in Industrial Engineering. During my Ph.D. career, I focused on ***spatial-temporal modelling*** and ***anomaly detection*** in high dimensional data by using statistics and machine learning knowledge. Since my research area is closely related to statistics, I pursued another master's degree in Statistics and Data Science since 2020. This program solidates my understanding in concepts such as probability, hypothesis test, regression, classification, and experimental design. In this August (Aug/2022), I passed the qualifying exams with a Ph.D. level pass and I am expected to get my second master degree in the winter (Dec/2022). 

**About my internship**
From Jan/2021 to Aug/2022, I worked as a ***research scientist intern*** in ABB, Raleigh. The main tasks for me were applying deep learning algorithms in real world industrial applications by using TensorFlow and PyTorch. At the beginning of the internship, due to the pandemic, obstacles occurred as we have limited data and limited hardware resources. However, with the help from my project manager, we began to make significant progress. I rotated between two research groups for different applications and contribute to the teams. At the end of the internship, the achievements I made were summarized into several patents which are now under filing.

After my internship, I came back to the campus. Now, I am working on several projects such as evaluating the safety of the autonomous vehicle and detecting anomalies in videos. I am also actively working on my dissertation.

**About my softskills**
During my internship and research career, I am always a ***quick learner***, and ready to get my hands "dirty". One example is the project for the automonous vehicle. This project requires me to integrate ROS (robotic operating system) with Autoware and Carla such that the data can be simulated. It is likely the most challenging project I have worked on as all the three platforms are new to me and there are few documents about such integration. Although I met tons of errors when I was trying to build the simulation pipeline, the good news is that I finally did it and now I am quite comfortable in using them. All of these were done in two months. With such experience, I believe I am capable in learning new tools quickly.

**About my life**
Besides my work, I really enjoy music and playing guitar. My favorite guitarist is Slash. Luckily, I had a chance to watch a Guns N' Roses' concert in Phoenix, AZ. Slash played like a killer. I also like photography and bring my camera with me all the time.

These are all about me. I appreciate that you read through all of these, thank you!
