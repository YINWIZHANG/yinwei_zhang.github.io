About me
======
I am self-motivated, persevering and curious to the unknown knowledge. I am a intern of robotics research group in ABB and the main task is to apply deep learning algorithms to robots and evaluate their performances under different environments. My research with my advisor Dr.Jian Liu in University of Arizona is related with spatial and temporal data analysis.
